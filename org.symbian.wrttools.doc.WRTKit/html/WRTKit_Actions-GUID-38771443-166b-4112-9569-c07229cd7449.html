Actions</h1>

        <p>

            Widgets can let users trigger actions in many ways. One way is by inserting menu 
            items in the Options menu, using the menu object that the S60 Web Runtime 
            defines. Another way is to use links that call JavaScript functions. Such links 
            could for example be included as part of content in a ContentPanel control. 
            Links belong more to web pages than widgets or applications, however, and are 
            not recommended except in cases when they result in a web URL being opened up in 
            a web browser (i.e. using the widget.openURL() method).
        </p>

        <p>

            The third way is to use one of the WRTKit action controls: FormButton and 
            NavigationButton. Both controls are very similar in usage but differ greatly in 
            presentation and intended use. The FormButton control is meant to be used in 
            situations where pressing the button would result in some kind of process taking 
            place, e.g. settings being saved. The NavigationButton control is intended for 
            moving between views inside the widget, or other similar type of actions. 
            FormButton controls look similar to buttons in a PC application or "Submit"-
            buttons on a web page. NavigatationButton controls don't really have a 
            counterpart in the PC application domain, but is common in mobile device 
            application that have large user interfaces that are split into several views.

        <p>

            In an email widget, NavigationButton controls could be used so that there would 
            be a "Folders"-view where each folder (e.g. Inbox, Sent, Trash, etc.) would have 
            a corresponding NavigationButton. Clicking on the button for a folder would open 
            up that folder in a new view. FormButton controls could be used for example in a 
            view that lets users write new emails to trigger sending of the written email. A 
            FormButton in a view like that could have "Send" as the button text.
        </p>

            <br /><img src="FormButton_Controls_Screenshot_1.png" /><br />
        </div>

        <p>

            The FormButton and NavigationButton controls fire events with the event type 
            "ActionPerformed" whenever a user presses the button. The event can be turned 
            into a function call to a callback function of the developer's choice by 
            registering the function to the control for the "ActionPerformed" event type. 
            This is done using the addEventListener() method that all controls inherit from 
            the UIElement base class.
