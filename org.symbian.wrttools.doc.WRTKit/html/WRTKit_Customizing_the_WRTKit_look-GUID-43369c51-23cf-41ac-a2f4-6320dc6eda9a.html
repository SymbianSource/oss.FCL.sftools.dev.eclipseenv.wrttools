Customizing the WRTKit look</h1>

    <div>

        <p>

            All visuals in the WRTKit are defined using CSS and images that are 
            located inside the WRTKit library in the Resources directory. The 
            code that implements the WRTKit user interface elements does not 
            actually know or care what the user interface looks like. Instead 
            the code creates an HTML element hierarchy to implement each control 
            and view and then sets CSS style class names to these elements. 
            Whenever the state changes (e.g. the control gets focused) the class 
            names are updated to reflect the new state. The CSS in the Resources 
            directory defines the style rules for the class names and visuals 
            are applied to the controls and views like for any other CSS styled 
            HTML elements. This results in a system where only CSS and images 
            need to be modified in order to implement a new look for a custom 
            WRTKit user interface - but no JavaScript code.
        </p>

        <p>

            All CSS rules for the WRTKit are defined in a file called UI.css in 
            the WRTKit library Resources directory. This file defines hundreds 
            of style classes and can seem intimidating and complex, but the 
            principle behind the classes is actually very simple. Each HTML 
            element in each control has a common class and a set of state-
            specific classes. E.g. the text element in the NavigationButton 
            control has "NavigationButtonText", "NavigationButtonTextNormal", 
            "NavigationButtonTextFocus", etc. The classes are applied based on 
            the current state of that element. So in our example if the button 
            was focused, the text element would be assigned the CSS classes 
            "NavigationButtonText" and "NavigationButtonTextFocus". Two classes 
            define all of the styling for the text element portion of the 
            NavigationButton control in the focused state.
        </p>

        <p>

            Using two classes at the same time is convenient because it allows 
            common elements to be defined in the common class and only special 
            adaptations of that common rule in the state-specific class. One 
            pattern that is repeated throughout the WRTKit is to define a 
            background image in the common class and an image position offset in 
            the state-specific class. This makes switching from one state to 
            another (e.g. when a checkbox is checked) very straight forward. 
            Even if the graphics appear to change, no images need to be loaded 
            or switched but instead just the image offset changes and the result 
            is that the graphics have changed.
        </p>

        <p>

            Controls and views use HTML element hierarchies that are fine 
            grained enough that various kinds of layout customizations can be 
            applied without having CSS styles affect parts of a control that 
            they were not intended to affect. The result is more CSS rules and 
            more expansive element hierarchies, but also more freedom and 
            flexibility.
        </p>

        <p>

            In most cases all that is needed to change the visuals of a WRTKit 
            user interface is to modify the images in the Resource directory and 
            update the color definitions for controls in the CSS file. The image 
            files that supply graphics to views and controls in the Resource 
            directory are named with clear names to make customization easy. 
            Just make a backup copy of the default graphics and CSS styles and 
            experiment! You will probably be surprised at how easy it is to make 
            a custom user interface theme!
