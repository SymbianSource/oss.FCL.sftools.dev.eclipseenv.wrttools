Control states</h1>

    <div>

        <p>

            Controls can be in a number of different states. Some of the states are specific
            to a particular type of control (e.g. whether a checkbox is checked) and some
            are common to all controls. Some states can be explicitly set while others are
            implicit based on some user action (e.g. moving the pointer over a control).
            The states can be retrieved using "getter" functions and in cases when a state
            can be explicitly set there is a "setter" function that allows the state to be
            manipulated. The following presents the common control states.

Focusable</h2>

            
            <p>

                The focusable state is a boolean (i.e. true or false) value that indicates
                whether the control can receive the focus and receive input or not. Some
                non-interactive controls like labels are never focusable, others are focusable
                unless the control has specifically been disabled, and some are always
                focusable. E.g. textfields can be focused even when disabled in order to be able
                to copy text from them to the clipboard.

        <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">
Focused</h2>

            
            <p>

                The focused state is a boolean value that specifies if a control is currently
                selected for interaction. The focused typically changes implicitly through user
                actions like moving the 4-way controller, however the focus can also be
                explicitly set. Unlike other states, setting the focus to a control is more like
                a request than an absolute command because it is not always possible to actually
                set the focus to the control to which it is requested. For example if a control
                is not focusable or not visible on the screen, the focus cannot be set to it.

Hovering</h2>

            
            <p>

                Hovering means that the pointer arrow is over a control. It is always implicit
                and changes based on pointer movement. The hovering state is a boolean value.
                The hovering state is rarely needed outside a control itself, which uses it to
                determine how the control draws itself.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">
Enabled</h2>

            
            <p>

                Controls are always enabled by default, but can be disabled to prevent
                interaction. Disabling a control doesn't hide it but rather causes it to be
                displayed in some way (typically with dimmer or duller colors) that indicates to
                users that it cannot be used. Toggling the enabled state is always an explicit
                action. The enabled state is a boolean value. Note that toggling the enabled
                state can have an effect on other things. Focus is typically lost from controls
                that are disabled and they become non-focusable.

Activated</h2>

            
            <p>

                Certain controls like textfields cannot be interacted with despite being
                focused. Instead the focus merely indicates that they are selected for
                interaction. In order to actually interact with them they have to be "activated"
                by pressing a selection button. The reason for this is that the same 4-way
                controller keys are used for navigating between controls and within a control.
                When a control such as a textfield is activated, all key presses are consumed by
                the control. Activation of a control is transparent to the WRTKit and due to
                this cannot be queried nor commanded. Also note that activation is not needed on
                PC computers and thus will not occur when testing a WRTKit user interface in a
                PC browser.
