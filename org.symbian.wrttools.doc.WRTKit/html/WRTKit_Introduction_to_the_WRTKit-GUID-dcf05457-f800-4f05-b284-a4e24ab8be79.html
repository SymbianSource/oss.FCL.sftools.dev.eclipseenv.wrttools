Introduction to the WRTKit</h1>

        <p>

            The S60 Web Runtime allows developers to use familiar web technologies like 
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create applications called "widgets" very easily. 
            But because widgets are based on web technologies they look and behave more like 
            web pages than S60 applications by default, which is not always desirable.
        </p>

        <p>

            Web pages use a document metaphor where content can be laid out arbitrarily. 
            Interaction with the web page is based on using a mouse or other similar device 
            to place a pointer arrow on elements on the web page and activating them by 
            pressing a button. When the pointer is over some user interface element it is 
            said to be "hovering". The element that the pointer is hovering over is often 
            displayed in a distinct style to show that it could be activated if the mouse 
            button was pressed.
        </p>

        <p>

            Mobile device applications, on the other hand, have limitations that make this 
            methapor less than ideal. The screen is small so discipline is needed to lay out 
            user interface elements in a way that is easy to understand for the user. The 
            physical controls on a mobile device are also not very suitable for moving 
            around a pointer arrow on the screen. Instead of having a pointer to select 
            elements the concept of "focus" is used. One of the elements on the screen is 
            considered selected and this selection can be moved between the user interface 
            elements using a 4-way controller. The element that is selected is said to be 
            "focused". Like for hovering, the focused element is displayed with a distinct 
            style to set it apart from other elements. This interaction method is called 
            "tab navigation" due to the fact that the tab key was originally used to move 
            the focus on PC computers.
        </p>

        <p>

            The S60 Web Runtime supports both the pointer-based and tab-based interaction 
            modes so that you can choose the one that fits your widget best. But while 
            simple user interfaces are easy to implement in both modes, more sophisticated 
            application-like user interfaces can be quite tricky. Hover and focus must be 
            handled correctly and the hover and focus states must be displayed consistently 
            throughout the user interface. Different screen sizes as well as screen resizes 
            and rotations must be taken into account. User interface controls like buttons, 
            checkboxes and scrollbars must be able to take on a look that fits the overall 
            visual theme of the widget, for example that of a commercial brand.
        </p>

        <p>

            The WRTKit is a complete library of JavaScript code, CSS style rules and 
            graphical elements that are required to implement the kind of sophisticated, 
            customizable, application-like user interfaces that are described above. It 
            gives widget developers an easy way to create high quality user interfaces 
            without having to worry about the problems that would otherwise plague their 
            widgets.
        </p>

        <p>

            When the WRTKit is used in a widget, complex and fully featured user interfaces 
            can be created with just a few lines of JavaScript code. The WRTKit takes care 
            of generating all the HTML and CSS automatically behind the scenes. What's more, 
            the visual look of the user interfaces created by the WRTKit is controlled 
            entirely using CSS, allowing complete customization without touching any code. 
            WRTKit user interfaces also work in standards-compliant PC web browsers, 
            enabling rapid development and debugging using familiar web development tools.
