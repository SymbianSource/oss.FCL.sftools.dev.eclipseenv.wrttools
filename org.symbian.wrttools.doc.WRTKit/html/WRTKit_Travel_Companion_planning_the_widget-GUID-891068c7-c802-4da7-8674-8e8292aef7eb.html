Designing the user interface</h2>

            
            <p>

                Because the Travel Companion is such a complex widget it is important to plan
                both the user interface and implementation carefully before starting to write
                any code. What are the most common use cases that we want to address with this
                widget? How will typical users be using the widget? What kind of future features
                might there be and can we plan for those already?
            </p>

            <p>

                Because the Travel Companion widget offers so much functionality and information
                it is important to present it in such a way that it doesn't overwhelm the user.
                To give the user a better idea of what is available and how to get to everything,
                we'll have a main view with nothing but navigation buttons to the other views in
                the widget. We'll implement this view using WRTKit NavigationButton controls and
                we will give each button its own icon so that the user can quickly see what the
                view is about.
            </p>

            <p>

                After some planning and talking to potential users we have decided to create
                a summary view that we will call "information view". This view will include the
                most important information in a single place so that the user can view it quickly
                without having to press any buttons to navigate around the widget. We'll put a
                world clock here, the current weather at home and at the local destination, and
                the latest news headlines. The information view will be entirely composed from
                WRTKit ContentPanel controls.
            </p>

            <p>

                In addition to the information view we'll have two more specialized views. We'll
                have a currency converter with two TextField controls (one for the home currency
                and one for the local) and two FormButton controls. One button will convert
                from the home currency to local currency and the other button will convert in the
                other direction. The second specialized view is a five day weather forecast. Like
                the information view this will be using ContentPanel controls and we will share
                the weather content used for the information view for this view.
            </p>

            <p>

                Finally we'll have a settings view that is accessible from the main view just like
                the other views in the widget. In many other widgets we might want to hide access
                to the settings view to the Options menu but in this case one of the common use
                cases is to configure where in the world you are so rather than hiding access to
                the view we want to present it clearly in the main view. The settings view will
                use SelectionMenu controls to allow users to select their home and local cities,
                SelectionList controls with a single option that will be presented as a checkbox
                to configure whether the cities are in daylight saving time or not, and a
                SelectionList control that lets the user select the temperature unit to use in
                the weather forecasts. Finally there will be two FormButton controls to let the
                user save or cancel any settings changes.
            </p>

            <p>

                When the widget starts will setup a timer that will call a timer callback function
                once every second. In the callback function we will check what view is currently
                active and we'll update the views (e.g. clock) so that the views stays up to date
                even if the user doesn't do anything. After all, the most common use case is to
                just have the information view open and not do anything other than glance at the
                information that is displayed.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">
Travel Companion widget files</h2>

            
            <p>

                All the files - HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images - have been created for you.
                You can find the completed widget with all its files in the Examples/TravelCompanion
                directory in the WRTKit SDK. The tutorial will assume that you will create your
                own Travel Companion widget by following the instructions but if you prefer you can
                just open up the ready made files and examine them as you read the tutorial. If you
                are creating the widget from scratch by following the tutorial's instructions then
                we suggest that you create a working directory for the new widget and copy over all
                other ready made files except TravelCompanion.js. All of our work will be on this
                file, but before we move on to that file we'll take a look at what other files the
                widget is using.
            </p>

            <p>

                Since we're using the WRTKit to implement our user interface we have the WRTKit
                library with all its files in a directory called "WRTKit".
            </p>

            <p>

                Like all widgets the Travel Companion has an Info.plist widget metadata file and an
                icon in a file called Icon.png. You'll also notice that there's a bunch of png
                image files in the widget directory. There's a file called ListViewCaptionLogo.png
                that we will use as a custom graphical element in the view caption in all of our
                views. Four png files have names starting with "Nav" and the rest start with
                "Weather". The image files that have names starting with "Nav" are icons for the
                NavigationButton controls for the main view. They are simply images that are
                30 by 30 pixels in size and have some graphical motif that captures what the button
                does. Note that the size of images used for navigation buttons doesn't have to be
                exactly 30 by 30 pixels - you can use any size you like. The images with names
                starting with "Weather" are images used in the weather forecasts. There is one image
                for each kind of weather that can be forecasted: rain, snow, sunshine, clouds, etc.
            </p>

            <p>

                You'll find two JavaScript files: Engine.js and TravelCompanion.js. The Engine.js
                file has the implementation of the business logic and the TravelCompanion.js file
                implements the widget and its user interface. Finally there is the main widget HTML
                file called TravelCompanion.html and a CSS file called TravelCompanion.css that
                contains all the style rules used in the widget - above that what the WRTKit defines
                by default, which is actually nearly everything!
            </p>

            <p>

                Let's take a quick peek at TravelCompanion.html:

                look very familiar. The file has no content, includes the WRTKit.js file from the
                WRTKit library directory, includes the JavaScript files that we are using to implement
                the Travel Companion widget, includes the TravelCompanion.css stylesheet file, and
                finally calls a function called init() when the widget has loaded everything.

The Travel Companion Engine</h2>

            
            <p>

                Following good software engineering principles, we are implementing the Travel Companion
                widget so that the user interface is decoupled from the implementation of the actual
                business logic that knows weather forecasts, calculates currency conversions, etc. The
                logic is outside of the scope for this tutorial since we're interested in learning about
                how to use the WRTKit - not how to convert euros to dollars. Because of this we will not
                look at all at how the business logic is implemented but we will take a close look at
                the interface between the user interface and the business logic engine. In fact, the 
                implementation of the engine for this example is a mock implementation and only mimics
                what a real engine would do. But since this is only an example that's quite alright.
                The engine interface, however, is identical to what it would be even if the engine would
                have a real implementation.
            </p>

            <p>

                The engine is implemented as a JavaScript class that you instantiate before using.
                The reason for being implemented as a class is simply so that the engine can better
                encapsulate its internal data and provide a kind of name space for its methods.
            </p>

            <p>

                The core concept in the Travel Companion engine is that of cities. The engine supports
                a list of cities and one will always be a "home city" and one a "local city". The
                same city can be both home and local. Home refers to the city where the user lives
                and local refers to the city where the user is currently located. The engine doesn't
                know the daylight saving time schedules for cities so this is configured manually by
                the user: one setting for the home city and one for the local city. The engine handles
                all preferences but the user interface must tell it to save preferences if some
                preference is modified. Preferences are automatically loaded when the engine is
                created, which should happen when the widget starts so that all the settings are
                available immediately.
            </p>

            <p>

                A city in the engine is a JavaScript object. A city object has the following public
                properties: name for the city name, currency for the three-letter currency abbreviation, 
                and timezone for the timezone code (e.g. GMT). Cities are created and managed entirely
                by the engine.
            </p>

            <p>

                Below is a complete list of the public engine APIs that are related to preferences and
                cities:
            </p>

            <p>

                Loading and saving preferences:
            </p>

<pre>

[void] Engine.loadPreferences(void)
[void] Engine.savePreferences(void)
</pre>

            <p>

                Retrieving all cities supported by the engine:
            </p>

<pre>

[Array] Engine.getCities(void)
</pre>

            <p>

                Retrieving a city based on its name:
            </p>

<pre>

[City] Engine.getCityByName(String name)
</pre>

            <p>

                Retrieving and settting the home city:
            </p>

<pre>

[City] Engine.getHomeCity(void)
[void] Engine.setHomeCity(City city)
</pre>

            <p>

                Retrieving and settting the home city daylight saving time setting:
            </p>

<pre>

[Boolean] Engine.getHomeCityDST(void)
[void] Engine.setHomeCityDST(Boolean dst)
</pre>

            <p>

                Retrieving and settting the local city:
            </p>

<pre>

[City] Engine.getLocalCity(void)
[void] Engine.setLocalCity(City city)
</pre>

            <p>

                Retrieving and settting the local city daylight saving time setting:
            </p>

<pre>

[Boolean] Engine.getLocalCityDST(void)
[void] Engine.setLocalCityDST(Boolean dst)
</pre>

            <p>

                Retrieving and setting the preferred temperature unit:
            </p>

<pre>

[String] Engine.getTemperatureUnit(void)
[void] Engine.setTemperatureUnit(String unit)
</pre>

            <p>

                Of course the engine isn't just about preferences. Its actual purpose is to perform
                various operations related to these cities, such as converting currencies, figuring
                out what the time is in a foreign city, etc. To simplify the usage of the engine,
                the public methods related to these operations are defined in terms of the home and
                local city as it is configured at the time when the method is called.
            </p>

            <p>

                Here's the full list of the actual operation methods that the engine supports:
            </p>

            <p>

                Currency conversions between home and local:
            </p>

<pre>

[Float] Engine.convertHomeToLocalMoney(Float amount)
[Float] Engine.convertLocalToHomeMoney(Float amount)
</pre>

            <p>

                Retrieving the current time in the home and local cities:
            </p>

<pre>

[DateTime] Engine.getHomeTime(void)
[DateTime] Engine.getLocalTime(void)
</pre>

            <p>

                The DateTime object returned by getHomeTime() and getLocalTime() is a JavaScript
                object that contains the following properties: year, month, date, day, hours, minutes,
                seconds, timezone. All properties are integers except the timezone, which is a string
                that represents the timezone code, e.g. "EET" for "Eastern European Time". Month and 
                day are zero-based to simplify their use as indexes in arrays that contains the month
                and week day names. These arrays can be found in the DateTime object. The array for
                week day names is called dayNames and the array for month names is called monthNames.
                Day 0 is Sunday and month 0 is January. To find out the name of the day represented
                by a DateTime object you would do the following:
            </p>

<pre>

var homeTime = engine.getHomeTime();
var dayOfWeekName = homeTime.dayNames[homeTime.day];
</pre>

            <p>

                Note that the default JavaScript Date object is not used because of its timezone-
                related limitations.
            </p>

            <p>

                Retrieving 5-day forecasts for the home and local cities:
            </p>

<pre>

[Array] Engine.getHomeWeather(void)
[Array] Engine.getLocalWeather(void)
</pre>

            <p>

                The array returned by the getHomeWeather() and getLocalWeather() methods contains
                the weather for the next five days so that the first element is the weather today,
                the second is the weather tomorrow, etc. Each item is a JavaScript object that
                has two properties: temperature, which is an integer in the preferred temperature
                unit, and type, which is a string that describes the weather. The type string is
                one of the following: "Sunny", "PartlyCloudy", "Cloudy", "Rain", "Sleet" or Snow".
                There is a weather type image for each of these, named so that there is a "Weather"
                prefix in front of the weather type and a ".png" suffix after it, e.g. "WeatherSunny.png".
            </p>

            <p>

                Retrieving an array of the latest news headlines:
            </p>

<pre>

[Array] Engine.getNewsHeadlines(void)
</pre>

            <p>

                Each item in the array that the getNewsHeadlines() method returns is a JavaScript
                object that describes one news headline. Each news headline object has two
                properties: headline for the actual news headline text and url for the website
                address where the full news article is located.
