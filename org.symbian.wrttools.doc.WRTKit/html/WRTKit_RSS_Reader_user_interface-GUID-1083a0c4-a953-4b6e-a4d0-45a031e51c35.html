Preferences</h2>

            
            <p>

                Now it's time to write some code so let's open up RSSReader.js. The first thing
                we will do is implement the init() function that gets called when the widget has
                loaded. We will begin by setting up the timer-based updating mechanism for the
                feed updates by declaring four variables that we'll need for that:
            </p>

<pre>

// Feed update timer identifier.
var updateTimerId = null;

// Feed URL and update frequency (in milliseconds; -1 if no auto update).
var feedURL = null;
var feedUpdateFrequency = -1;

// Next scheduled update time; -1 if never.
var feedUpdateTime = -1;
</pre>

            <p>

                We know that we'll need to get some working values for the feed URL and feed update
                frequency variables and we know that they will be configurable values so let's write
                the code for this:
            </p>

<pre>

// Called from the onload event handler to initialize the widget.
function init() {
    // load preferences
    loadPreferences();

    // start feed update timer (called once every second)
    updateTimerId = setInterval(updateFeedTimerFunc, 1000);
}

// Loads widget preferences.
function loadPreferences() {
    if (window.widget) {
        // read feed URL and update frequency from the widget settings
        feedURL = widget.preferenceForKey("FeedURL");
        var feedUpdateFrequencyStr = widget.preferenceForKey("FeedUpdateFrequency");
        feedUpdateFrequency = (feedUpdateFrequencyStr == null) ? -1 : parseInt(feedUpdateFrequencyStr);
    }
}

// Timer function for feed updates - called once every second.
function updateFeedTimerFunc() {
    
}
</pre>

            <p>

                The init() function does two things at this point. First it calls our newly created
                loadPreferences() function that takes care of reading some values for the feedURL
                and feedUpdateFrequency variables. After this it starts up an interval timer that
                calls updateFeedTimerFunc() once every second. The function doesn't do anything
                yet but we'll get to that in a bit. The timer identifier is stored in the updateTimerId 
                variable. If no configuration is found, feedURL will have a value of null and
                feedUpdateFrequency will have a value of -1. Note that all preferences are stored
                as strings so we need to parse the string value to an integer. Also note that we
                wrapped the preference loading code in an if-clause that checks if we are in the
                S60 Web Runtime environment. This allows us to run the code in a PC browser without
                getting an error message about the widget -related methods that don't exist outside
                of the S60 Web Runtime.
            </p>

            <p>

                While we're on the topic of preferences we'll write a save counterpart for the
                loadPreferences() function.
            </p>

<pre>

// Saves widget preferences.
function savePreferences() {
    if (window.widget) {
        // save settings in widget preferences store
        widget.setPreferenceForKey(feedURL, "FeedURL");
        widget.setPreferenceForKey(feedUpdateFrequency.toString(), "FeedUpdateFrequency");
    }
}
</pre>

            <p>

                We're now almost done with the timer mechanism that will update the RSS feed but
                we are missing one thing: a way to manually schedule an immediate update of the
                feeds. Let's add a flag that we can use to track if an update was triggered
                automatically or manually:
            </p>

<pre>

// Flag that tracks if a feed update is commanded or automatic.
var feedUpdateCommanded = false;
</pre>

            <p>

                And now let's add a function that can be called to schedule an immediate update:
            </p>

<pre>

// Schedules an immediate feed update.
function updateFeed() {
    feedUpdateTime = 0;
    feedUpdateCommanded = true;
}
</pre>

            <p>

                The function just sets the next update time to 0 so that the next time the
                timer function runs it will notice that it's time to schedule a feed update.
                The function also sets the feedUpdateCommanded flag to true so that the
                updating mechanism will know that this was a manual update.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">
Creating the user interface</h2>

            
            <p>

                Now let's create the user interface. We'll start by declaring three variables
                where we will hold references to the user interface manager, main view and settings
                view. Note that these should be outside the init() function.
            </p>

<pre>

// References to the WRTKit user interface manager and views.
var uiManager;
var mainView;
var settingsView;
</pre>

            <p>

                We want our user interface to be in tab navigation mode and we want the softkey
                bar to be visible. The code for this is the same as in the Hello World example.
                Next we create the user interface manager, main view and settings view by adding
                the following code to the init() function:
            </p>

<pre>

if (window.widget) {
    // set tab-navigation mode and show softkeys
    widget.setNavigationEnabled(false);
    menu.showSoftkeys();
}

// create UI manager
uiManager = new UIManager();

// create main view
mainView = new ListView();

// create settings view
settingsView = new ListView(null, "Settings");
</pre>

            <p>

                You might have noticed that we didn't supply any arguments to the ListView constructor
                when the main view was created. The reason for this is that we will set the view caption
                dynamically depending on the news feed we are following. And since we don't need the
                unique identifier for the main view we don't even have to pass null to it. Remember: in
                JavaScript if you don't pass an argument it will be undefined, which is equal to null.
            </p>

            <p>

                The main view will not get populated with controls until we have some news feed items
                to display, but we can go ahead and create the settings view. Again, we will first
                declare variables to hold references to the controls and again, they should be declared
                outside the init() method so that they are accessible elsewhere in the widget code:
            </p>

<pre>

// Reference to settings controls.
var feedSelection;
var feedUpdateFrequencySelection;
var settingsSaveButton;
var settingsCancelButton;
</pre>

            <p>

                Now that we have variables to receive the control references we can go ahead and create
                them and add them to the settings view. We will create a SelectionMenu control to let
                the user select the RSS feed to show, a SelectionList control to allow selection of
                the feed update frequency and two form buttons: "Save" and "Cancel". The SelectionMenu
                and SelectionList controls are identical from a developer's point of view but look
                very different. The SelectionMenu takes up very little space in the view but when clicked
                it pops up a list of options that the user can select from. This is good if theres a lot
                of options and we don't want to use up a lot of space from the view. The SelectionList
                is the exact opposite and shows all the options right there in the view. This is good
                if the widget is in pointer navigation mode or if there are very few options.
            </p>

            <p>

                Options for the SelectionMenu and SelectionList controls are defined as an array of
                JavaScript objects that have two properties: value and text. The value property contains
                the actual data of the option and the text property contains the string to display to
                the user. Before we create the controls we need to create the option arrays for the
                RSS feed options and update frequency options. These will simply be hard coded arrays
                that are defined using JavaScript object notation (JSON) and we'll place them at the top
                of the widget code so that they can be easily customized later on:
            </p>

<pre>

// Feed source options.
var feedOptions = [
    { value: "http://www.womworld.com/nseries/feed/", text: "Nseries WOM World" },
    { value: "http://feeds.feedburner.com/N958GB", text: "N95 8GB News" },
    { value: "http://feeds.feedburner.com/N95", text: "N95 News" },
    { value: "http://feeds.feedburner.com/N93", text: "N93 News" },
    { value: "http://feeds.feedburner.com/N91", text: "N91 News" },
    { value: "http://feeds.feedburner.com/N82", text: "N82 News" },
    { value: "http://feeds.feedburner.com/N81", text: "N81 News" },
    { value: "http://feeds.feedburner.com/N810", text: "N810 News" },
    { value: "http://feeds.feedburner.com/N800", text: "N800 News" },
    { value: "http://feeds.feedburner.com/N76", text: "N76 News" }
];

// Feed update frequency.
var updateFrequencyOptions = [
    { value: -1, text: "never" },
    { value: (1000 * 60 * 5), text: "every 5 min" },
    { value: (1000 * 60 * 15), text: "every 15 min" },
    { value: (1000 * 60 * 60), text: "every 60 min" },
];
</pre>

            <p>

                The RSS feeds are all from the Nokia Nseries WOM World website but you could put any
                RSS feed URLs here that you like. However it is probably a good idea to stick with
                these for now since we know that they work. Later when the widget is completed you can try
                with other feeds. Note how the value is a URL but the text to display is a human readable
                name for the RSS feeds.
            </p>

            <p>

                The update frequency options are defined in milliseconds and there is one option with a
                magic value of -1 for "never". Here too you'll notice the difference between the value
                (an integer in this case) and the human readable text.
            </p>

            <p>

                Now that we have the option arrays we can create the controls for the settings view by
                adding the following code to the init() function:
            </p>

<pre>

    // feed selection control
    feedSelection = new SelectionMenu(null, "Select feed", feedOptions);
    settingsView.addControl(feedSelection);
    
    // feed update frequency selection control
    feedUpdateFrequencySelection = new SelectionList(null, "Check for updates", updateFrequencyOptions);
    settingsView.addControl(feedUpdateFrequencySelection);
    
    // save settings button
    settingsSaveButton = new FormButton(null, "Save");
    settingsView.addControl(settingsSaveButton);
    
    // cancel settings button
    settingsCancelButton = new FormButton(null, "Cancel");
    settingsView.addControl(settingsCancelButton);
</pre>

            <p>

                The two first arguments for the SelectionMenu and SelectionList constructors are the
                same as for most other controls: a unique identifier and a control caption. The third 
                argument points to the array of options that the controls should display. You could
                also have omitted that argument from the constructor and instead called setOptions()
                later on, but why do it in two steps when you can do it in one?
            </p>

            <p>

                The user interface views are now done (minus the actual news items to display in the main
                view of course) but we still have some things to implement for the user interface. The
                buttons in the settings view don't do anything yet so let's fix that.
            </p>

            <p>

                The cancel button should take the user to the main view and the save button should
                start using the newly configured settings, save them, and then go to the main view.
                Our plan to implement this is to create a function for showing the main view, called
                "showMainView()", a similar function for showing the settings view that we will call
                "showSettings()", and a function that will be called when the save button is clicked
                called "saveSettingsClicked()". We will then add event listeners to the two buttons
                so that clicking the save button will result in a call to the saveSettingsClicked()
                function and clicking the cancel button will result in a call to the showMainView()
                function. Let's create empty placeholders for the functions first:
            </p>

<pre>

// Callback for settings view save button.
function saveSettingsClicked() {
}

// Show main view.
function showMainView() {
}

// Show settings view.
function showSettings() {
}
</pre>

            <p>

                Now that we have those functions let's register the event listeners to the form
                buttons by adding these two lines of code immediately after where the buttons
                are created:
            </p>

<pre>

settingsSaveButton.addEventListener("ActionPerformed", saveSettingsClicked);
settingsCancelButton.addEventListener("ActionPerformed", showMainView);
</pre>

            <p>

                We are now ready to implement the functions to show the main view, settings view
                and react to the save button click. But we won't implement those just yet because
                we want to do one more thing before that. Let's create the custom Options menu.
                The Options menu isn't using any WRTKit code but rather the standard S60 Web Runtime
                widget menu functionality. We'll have two menu items: "Refresh" to schedule an immediate
                news feed update and "Settings" to go to the settings view. The Web Runtime Options
                menu works so that a callback function gets called when the user selections an Options
                menu item. In order to recognize which menu item was selected we'll need a unique
                identifier for each of them. Let's create those:
            </p>

<pre>

// Constants for menu item identifiers.
var MENU_ITEM_SETTINGS = 0;
var MENU_ITEM_REFRESH = 1;
</pre>

            <p>

                Next we'll create the callback function that will be called when the menu items are
                selected:
            </p>

<pre>

// Callback for when menu items are selected.
function menuItemSelected(id) {
    switch (id) {
        case MENU_ITEM_SETTINGS:
            showSettings();
            break;
        case MENU_ITEM_REFRESH:
            updateFeed();
            break;
    }
}
</pre>

            <p>

                This function gets the menu item identifier passed to it when the user selects
                a menu item. The switch-case will branch off to call showSettings() if the "Settings"
                menu item was selected and updateFeed() if the "Refresh" menu item was selected.
                But we haven't actually created the menu yet so let's do that by adding this to the
                init() function right after where we show the softkey bar. We want to have this piece
                of code inside the if-clause that checks if we're in the S60 Web Runtime because we
                don't have the Options menu functionality on a PC browser.
            </p>

<pre>

// create menu
var settingsMenuItem = new MenuItem("Settings", MENU_ITEM_SETTINGS);
settingsMenuItem.onSelect = menuItemSelected;
menu.append(settingsMenuItem);
var refreshMenuItem = new MenuItem("Refresh", MENU_ITEM_REFRESH);
refreshMenuItem.onSelect = menuItemSelected;
menu.append(refreshMenuItem);
</pre>

            <p>

                The code simply creates two MenuItem objects, gives them a label and a unique
                identifier, specifies the callback function to call when selected and then adds
                them to the Options menu. The menu object is a global object that automatically
                exists in the S60 Web Runtime.
            </p>

            <p>

                Now let's return to the three functions we created but didn't implement. We will
                start with the showMainMenu() function. This function should perform all necessary
                steps to show the main menu. This includes the following: setting a caption for
                the main view, setting the right softkey to be the default "Exit" label and 
                functionality, and then actually showing the main view by calling setView() in the
                user interface manager. We'll get the main view caption by checking which of the
                RSS feeds the user has currently selected. We do this by looping through the feed
                options and looking for the feed URL that is currently in use. If we can't find one
                we'll default to "RSS Reader".
            </p>

<pre>

// Show main view.
function showMainView() {
    // set main view caption from feed name
    var feedName = null;
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; feedOptions.length; i++) {
        if (feedOptions[i].value == feedURL) {
            feedName = feedOptions[i].text;
            break;
        }
    }
    var mainViewCaption = (feedName == null) ? "RSS Reader" : feedName;
    mainView.setCaption(mainViewCaption);
    
    // set right softkey to "exit"
    if (window.widget) {
        menu.setRightSoftkeyLabel("", null);
    }
    
    // show the main view
    uiManager.setView(mainView);
}
</pre>

            <p>

                When the settings view is shown we first want to place the controls into
                a state that reflects the current configuration. In other words we want
                the currently configured feed to be the one that's selected in the feed selection
                control. In the same way the currently configured feed update frequency should
                be selected in the feed update frequency selection control. There is a very
                convenient method available for this called getOptionForValue(). Using that
                function we can pass the currently configured feed URL and feed update frequency
                and get back the options object that corresponds to the configuration value.
                After this we can use that options object when we call setSelected() to select
                that option.
            </p>

            <p>

                If there is no valid configuration then we disable the cancel button and make
                the right softkey be "Exit". This is useful when the widget is started for the
                first time so that user has to enter a valid configuration before starting to
                use the widget. If there is a valid configuration we set the right softkey to
                "Cancel" and make it call the showMainView() function that we just created. The
                "Cancel" button will also be enabled.
            </p>

            <p>

                Finally we'll switch to the settings view by calling setView() in the user 
                interface manager.
            </p>

<pre>

// Show settings view.
function showSettings() {
    // URL (use first available feed if null)
    var feedOption = (feedURL == null) ? feedOptions[0] : feedSelection.getOptionForValue(feedURL);
    feedSelection.setSelected(feedOption);
    
    // frequency
    var feedUpdateFrequencyOption = feedUpdateFrequencySelection.getOptionForValue(feedUpdateFrequency);
    feedUpdateFrequencySelection.setSelected(feedUpdateFrequencyOption);
    
    if (feedURL == null) {
        // no valid configuration
        // disable cancel button - set right softkey to "exit"
        settingsCancelButton.setEnabled(false);
        if (window.widget) {
            menu.setRightSoftkeyLabel("", null);
        }
    } else {
        // we have a valid configuration
        // enable cancel button - set right softkey to "cancel"
        settingsCancelButton.setEnabled(true);
        if (window.widget) {
            menu.setRightSoftkeyLabel("Cancel", showMainView);
        }
    }
    
    // show the settings view
    uiManager.setView(settingsView);
}
</pre>

            <p>

                The third function to implement is the callback for when the save button is clicked.
                First we take the selected options from the feed selection and feed update frequency
                selection controls. Those selected values are copied to the feedURL and feedUpdateFrequency
                variables that are used by the widget during runtime. Next the settings are saved using
                the savePreferences() function that we implemented earlier. And finally we call the
                showMainView() method so that the widget shows the main view with the news items.
            </p>

<pre>

// Callback for settings view save button.
function saveSettingsClicked() {
    // update feed URL
    var selectedFeed = feedSelection.getSelected();
    feedURL = (selectedFeed != null) ? selectedFeed.value : null;
    
    // update frequency
    var selectedFrequency = feedUpdateFrequencySelection.getSelected();
    feedUpdateFrequency = (selectedFrequency != null) ? selectedFrequency.value : -1;
    
    // save preferences
    savePreferences();
    
    // return to main view
    showMainView();
}
</pre>

            <p>

                The user interface is now nearly done but the init() function needs one more
                thing. We need to show a view after the function is done initializing
                the widget. The view to show depeneds on whether we have a valid
                configuration or not. If we do then we'll show the main view. If not then
                we'll show the settings view. Let's add this code to the end of the init()
                function, just before we start the update timer:
            </p>

<pre>

// display the main view if a feed has been configured
// otherwise show the settings view
if (feedURL != null) {
    showMainView();
    updateFeed();
} else {
    showSettings();
}
</pre>

            <p>

                You can now go ahead and try out the widget either on a handset, emulator
                or in a PC browser. You should have a working settings view and when clicking
                the save button in the settings view you should end up in the main view. From
                there you can go to the settings by selecting "Settings" in the Options menu.
            </p>

            <p>

                There are no news items to show yet but that's our next task.
            </p>
