Control</h2>

            
            <p>

                A control is a user interface element that the user can interact with. Controls
                are used in PC applications, in web pages and in mobile device applications. In
                web pages controls are often known as "form controls". Common controls include
                textfields, textareas, buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, scrollbars, labels
                and progress bars, among others. Not all controls are interactive, e.g. labels
                simply display a value. Controls are contained within some kind of user
                interface container such as a view or window.
            </p>

            <p>

                In the WRTKit, controls are JavaScript objects that contain the state and
                implement the behavior of the control. Controls take care of drawing themselves,
                including changing their appearence as a result of various state changes.

View</h2>

            
            <p>

                A container for user interface elements such as controls. On a mobile device
                user interface views typically fill the entire screen and thus only one view can
                be shown at a time. Views in a mobile device tend to lay out the elements it
                contains in a vertical list that can be scrolled up and down if there is more
                content in the view than what fits on the screen at a time.
            </p>

            <p>

                In the WRTKit, views are responsible for laying out controls. Custom views can
                be created to support advanced layouts but in the vast majority of cases the
                default ListView is sufficient. WRTKit views are JavaScript objects.

Event</h2>

            
            <p>

                An event is a notification of some occurrence in a user interface element, such
                as a view or control. Events are typically propagated to application code as
                messages or function calls or a combination of the two.
            </p>

            <p>

                The WRTKit uses a model known as the "observer pattern" to deliver event
                messages, which are JavaScript objects, to event listeners, which are JavaScript
                callback functions. WRTKit events have a type name that can be used to
                distinguish between different types of events. E.g. a button press produces an
                "ActionPerformed" event.

Focus</h2>

            
            <p>

                The control that is currently selected to receive input is said to be focused.
                Controls can be focused in both the tab and pointer navigation modes. In the tab
                mode the focus is moved between controls using the 4-way controller. In
                the pointer mode the focus is moved between controls by moving the pointer to
                "hover" above a control and then pressing a selection button to select that
                control. Focused controls are displayed in a distinct way from other controls to
                indicate that they are ready to be interacted with.
            </p>

Hovering</h2>

            
            <p>

                In pointer navigation mode, the pointer is said to be "hovering" above a control
                if the pointer is located inside the control's area on the screen. Hovering is
                similar to focus, but differs because hovering in itself does not select a
                control for interaction. Rather a selection key must be pressed in order to
                focus the control that the pointer is currently hovering over. Hover is
                indicated by displaying a control in a distinct way from other controls.
            </p>

Navigation mode</h2>

            
            <p>

                A navigation mode refers to a method of selecting what user interface element to
                interact with. The S60 Web Runtime supports two navigation modes: "tab" and
                "pointer". In the tab mode, focus is moved between controls using the 4-way
                controller. In pointer mode there is a pointer arrow on the screen that can be
                moved freely using the 4-way controller. A control is focused by moving the
                pointer arrow so that it hovers above a control, and then pressing a selection
                key to select that control. In tab mode a control can be either in normal or
                focused state, whereas in the pointer mode a control can be in normal, hover or
                focused state.
