Fetching news items</h2>

            
            <p>

                Before we can show any news items we have to fetch them. So let's take
                a break in implementing the user interface and write the code that fetches
                the news items. The majority of that code is in the FeedUpdateBroker.js file
                in a JavaScript class called FeedUpdateBroker. We'll only be using one single
                method from that class: fetchFeed(). But how do we hook that up to our widget?
            </p>

            <p>

                The actual call to fetchFeed() will be done from the timer function updateFeedTimerFunc()
                that runs once a second. There we'll need an if-clause that checks if it's time
                to update the feeds, if another update is already going on, if we have a valid URL
                that we can fetch and if we're in the main view. If all of these tests tell us
                that it's time to update the feed, we'll check if the feed update was manually
                commanded or automatically triggered because it was time to update the feed in
                the background. If this is a manual update then we'll popup a progress notification 
                dialog. Next we'll create a new instance of the FeedUpdateBroker class and call
                the fetchFeed() method to start the AJAX-based RSS feed update. We need to pass
                two arguments to this method: the feed URL that we have in the feedURL variable
                and a callback function that should be called when the update is completed.
            </p>

            <p>

                We don't have that function yet so that's the first thing we need to implement.
                We'll leave it empty for now but return to it in a bit:
            </p>

<pre>

// Callback function that gets called when a feed update has completed.
function feedUpdateCompleted(event) {
}
</pre>

            <p>

                After we call the fetchFeed() function we'll schedule the next feed update. In
                theory we shouldn't do this until the feed update completes since there is a risk
                that we do two updates at the same time. But because we're adding a check to
                only do feed updates if another update isn't on-going this risk isn't actually
                real. Now that we have a plan for how to update the feed, let's write the code.
                First we need to declare a variable for the feed update broker instance that
                we'll create:
            </p>

<pre>

// Feed update broker.
var feedUpdateBroker = null;
</pre>

            <p>

                Then the actual implementation for the updateFeedTimerFunc() timer function:
            </p>

<pre>

// Timer function for feed updates - called once every second.
function updateFeedTimerFunc() {
    var now = new Date().getTime();
    
    // check if a feed update has been scheduled, if it's time to update now,
    // and if there's no update currently in progress and if we're in the main view
    if ((feedURL != null) &amp;&amp;
                (feedUpdateTime != -1) &amp;&amp;
                (now &gt; feedUpdateTime) &amp;&amp;
                (feedUpdateBroker == null) &amp;&amp; 
                (uiManager.getView() == mainView)) {
        // show progress dialog if this is a commanded feed update
        if (feedUpdateCommanded) {
            // no auto hiding, wait-type notification, unknown progress
            uiManager.showNotification(-1, "wait", "Loading feed...", -1);
        }
        
        // fetch the feed from the specified URL
        feedUpdateBroker = new FeedUpdateBroker();
        feedUpdateBroker.fetchFeed(feedURL, feedUpdateCompleted);
        
        if (feedUpdateFrequency != -1) {
            // schedule next update
            feedUpdateTime = now + feedUpdateFrequency;
        } else {
            // feed update frequency is "never"
            feedUpdateTime = -1;
        }
    }
}
</pre>

            <p>

                The progress dialog is created so that it has a display time of -1 so that
                it doesn't automatically hide but rather has to be commanded to go away. The
                notification dialog type is "wait" and we'll give a progress of -1 since we
                don't know how far along in the feed updating process we are. A negative 
                progress value like -1 means "unknown progress" and will result in an animated
                progress indicator that shows that something is going on but the exact time
                that it will take is unknown.
            </p>

            <p>

                Our feed updating should now be working and whenever a feed update is completed
                there should be a call to the empty feedUpdateCompleted() function. Let's 
                continue the implementation there.
            </p>

            <p>

                When the feedUpdateCompleted() function is called it receives an event object
                from the FeedUpdateBroker. This object contains a status that is either "ok"
                or "error", a "lastModifiedTime" string that contains the time when the RSS
                feed was last modified to help us decide if there are any new news items to
                display, as well as an array of news item objects in a property called "items".
                If the status is "error" then we'll show an error notification dialog. Keep in
                mind that there might or might not be a progress dialog already showing at this
                time. Either way we can just call the showNotification() function in the user
                interface manager because if another dialog is already visible then it will simply
                replace it with the one that we asked it to show. If the status is "ok" then we'll
                call hideNotification() in the user interface manager. This will hide the progress
                dialog if it's showing and if the dialog wasn't showing then the call will just
                be ignored.
            </p>

            <p>

                We'll then need to compare the lastModifiedTime against the last news feed that
                we have. That means we'll need to track the lastModifiedTime of whatever news
                feed that we are showing, and that means we need a new global variable:
            </p>

<pre>

// Time when the feed was last modified.
var feedLastModified = null;
</pre>

            <p>

                If the lastModifiedTime is different from the one that we are storing in the
                feedLastModified variable then we know that there's new news items to show.
                If this is the case then we'll update the feedLastModified time and set the news
                items to the main view. We could do something fancy and only update the news items
                that have been modified but to keep the tutorial simple we'll just simply remove
                all the current items and replace them with the new items and then focus the first
                of the items. But before we move on to that we'll write as much as we can of the
                feedUpdateCompleted() function:
            </p>

<pre>

// Callback function that gets called when a feed update has completed.
function feedUpdateCompleted(event) {
    if (event.status == "ok") {
        // if there aren't any feed items yet, we'll hide the progress dialog
        if (feedUpdateCommanded) {
            uiManager.hideNotification();
        }
        
        // check if the feed has updated
        if (event.lastModified != feedLastModified) {
            // remember the last modified timestamp
            feedLastModified = event.lastModified;
            
            // update news item controls here
        }
    } else {
        // show error message
        uiManager.showNotification(3000, "warning", "Error while updating feed!&lt;br/&gt;(check network settings)");
    }
    
    // null the broker reference to indicate that there's no current
    // update in progress
    feedUpdateBroker = null;
        
    // reset commanded feed update flag
    feedUpdateCommanded = false;
}
</pre>

            <p>

                We wrote a comment "update news item controls here" at the spot where we will
                actually create and add news feed items to the main view. We'll replace that in
                a bit with the actual code to do the job, but first we need to write some code
                that we'll need to do that.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">
Showing news items</h2>

            
            <p>

                The news feed items will be shown using ContentPanel controls. We'll need a way
                to keep track of the ones we're showing so that we can easily remove them when
                there is new news items to show. Let's create an array to track them:
            </p>

<pre>

// Reference to current feed items controls.
var feedItemControls = [];
</pre>

            <p>

                Now we can implement a function that will remove all controls that are tracked
                by this array from the main view. We'll use this as the first step when we want
                to display news items.
            </p>

<pre>

// Removes feed items.
function removeFeedItems() {
    // remove all current feed items from the main view
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; feedItemControls.length; i++) {
        mainView.removeControl(feedItemControls[i]);
    }
    
    // reset feed item control array
    feedItemControls = [];
}
</pre>

            <p>

                The function simply loops through the array and calls the removeControl() method
                in the main view to remove each of the feed item controls from the view, one at a time.
                Finally we'll reset the feedItemControls array so that it reflects the fact that
                there are no more controls in the main view.
            </p>

            <p>

                What about adding news items? We'll do that in a function that we'll call from the
                feedUpdateCompleted() function. Let's call the function setFeedItems(). The function
                will start by calling the removeFeedItems() function we just created to empty the 
                main view from news items before we start adding new ones to it. After this we'll
                loop through the news feed items that were handed to us from the FeedUpdateBroker.
                For each one we need a ContentPanel control. We'll be recycling the controls instead
                of constantly creating new ones over and over again as new news items come in. To
                this end we'll need a way to track ContentPanel controls that we have already
                created. We'll do this by creating an array called feedItemControlPool, which will
                be a global variable:
            </p>

<pre>

// Feed item control pool.
var feedItemControlPool = [];
</pre>

            <p>

                If we have enough controls in the pool we'll just take them from there. Otherwise
                we'll create a new ContentPanel and add it to the pool. Either way we'll end up with
                a ContentPanel control that is ready to be used. We'll need to reset its state since we
                recycled it, so we make sure it's collapsed rather than expanded, we'll set its caption
                to the title of the news item and we'll generate some HTML from the news item summary
                that we'll set as the content for the ContentPanel. And then finally we'll add the
                ContentPanel to the main view.
            </p>

            <p>

                Lets create the code but skip the HTML for the news item summary for now:
            </p>

<pre>

// Sets feed items.
function setFeedItems(items) {
    // start by removing all current feed items
    removeFeedItems();
    
    // create new feed items and add them to the main view
    // use feed item pool to recycle controls
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; items.length; i++) {
        // get a feed item control from the pool or create one and
        // place it in the pool if there aren't enough feed item controls
        var feedItemControl;
        if (i == feedItemControlPool.length) {
            feedItemControl = new ContentPanel(null, null, null, true);
            feedItemControlPool.push(feedItemControl);
        } else {
            feedItemControl = feedItemControlPool[i];
        }
        
        // initialize feed item control
        var item = items[i];
        feedItemControl.setCaption(item.title);
        feedItemControl.setContent("placeholder");
        feedItemControl.setExpanded(false);
        
        // add the feed item control to the main view
        feedItemControls.push(feedItemControl);
        mainView.addControl(feedItemControl);
    }
}
</pre>

            <p>

                The items argument contains the array of news items that we received in the event
                object argument to the feedUpdateCompleted() callback function. The items are in
                the "items" property of the event object. Note how the feedItemControl is either
                created or taken from the feedItemControlPool. If it's created it is given four
                arguments: a null unique identifier because we don't need one, a null caption and
                a null content because we will set both every time before we show it, and finally
                a value of true to the "foldable" argument in the ContentPanel constructor. This
                flag determines whether the ContentPanel can be folded (expanded and collapsed) or
                not. We want a foldable one so we pass true to this argument.
            </p>

            <p>

                Once we have the ContentPanel (either from the pool or newly created) we set its
                state: caption, content and expanded state. Note that for now we'll just set a
                placeholder string as the content. Also note that we set the expanded state to false
                to collapse the news items by default. Finally we add the content panels to the main
                view and to the feedItemControls array that tracks all the ContentPanels that we use
                for the news items.
            </p>

            <p>

                Now that we have written the code to create and add news items to the main view
                we have to hook that up to the feedUpdateCompleted() function. Remember we added
                a comment in the spot where we should return to do this? Let's replace that comment
                with the following:
            </p>

<pre>

// set feed items to the main view
setFeedItems(event.items);

// focus the first feed item control
// (but only if we are in the main view)
if (uiManager.getView() == mainView &amp;&amp; feedItemControls.length &gt; 0) {
    feedItemControls[0].setFocused(true);
}
</pre>

            <p>

                We just call the setFeedItems() function we just wrote, passing it the feed items
                that the FeedUpdateBroker fetched and parsed for us, and then if we're in the main
                view we'll focus the first of the news feed item controls.
            </p>

            <p>

                Now that we have all the code needed to fetch and update news feed items we'll go
                back and add some more functionality to a function we wrote a little bit earlier:
                the saveSettingsClicked() function.
            </p>

            <p>

                The functionality that we're adding will handle updates of the feed items in the
                main view after the user has modified the settings. We didn't write this earlier
                because we didn't have all the necessary support code in place but we can add it now.
                First we add some code to the end of the saveSettingsClicked() function to force an
                update of the news items after the users saves the settings:
            </p>

<pre>

// update the feed
feedLastModified = null;
updateFeed();
</pre>

            <p>

                We update the feed by setting the feedLastModified variable to null to force an update
                and then calling updateFeed(). This causes an immediate feed update and we also get the
                progress notification dialog, which is what we want because this was a manual
                update that was caused by the user clicking "save".
            </p>

            <p>

                Let's also add some code that checks if a new feed was selected and removes all the
                news items from the main view if the user selected a new feed. To do this we'll first
                copy the old feedURL to a variable that we'll call oldFeedURL at the very beginning
                of the function:
            </p>

<pre>

// remember the old feed URL
var oldFeedURL = feedURL;
</pre>

            <p>

                Then we'll add the following just before we show the main view:
            </p>

<pre>

// remove all feed items if the user selected a new feed
if (feedURL != oldFeedURL) {
    removeFeedItems();
}
</pre>

            <p>

                We can now test this in a PC browser, handset or emulator. Everything should work
                except that there's still nothing but a placeholder for the actual content in each
                ContentPanel. You can still expand and collapse the ContentPanels and the settings
                and automatic and manual updates are working. We're almost done but we still need
                to implement the code that will actually show news item summaries in the content
                panels.

                Remember we said that we would implement news items so that there's a link from
                each news item to the website where the full article is. When you open links
                to external websites in the S60 Web Runtime you should use the widget.openURL()
                function. But PC browsers don't have that function so we'll need to create a wrapper
                function that either calls widget.openURL() if we're in the Web Runtime or just
                opens a new window if we're in a PC browser.
            </p>

<pre>

// Opens a URL.
function openURL(url) {
    if (window.widget) {
        // in WRT
        widget.openURL(url);
    } else {
        // outside WRT
        window.open(url, "NewWindow");
    }
}
</pre>

            <p>

                Content in a ContentPanel control is a fragment of HTML. In other words it's a
                piece of HTML that will be inserted into the control using code. That means that
                in order to display the news item we will have to generate some HTML for it.
                We need a function that will take a news item object and return some HTML that
                we can give to thet setContent() method in the ContentPanel control. Let's write
                that function:
            </p>

<pre>

// Returns the content HTML for a feed item.
function getContentHTMLForFeedItem(item) {
    var buf = "";
    
    // item date
    if (item.date != null) {
        buf += "&lt;div class=\"FeedItemDate\"&gt;" + item.date + "&lt;/div&gt;";
    }
    
    // item description
    if (item.description != null) {
        buf += "&lt;div class=\"FeedItemDescription\"&gt;" + item.description + "&lt;/div&gt;";
    }
    
    // item URL
    if (item.url != null) {
        buf += "&lt;div class=\"FeedItemLink\"&gt;";
            buf += "&lt;a href=\"JavaScript:openURL('" + item.url + "');\"&gt;";
            buf += "Read more...";
            buf += "&lt;/a&gt;";
        buf += "&lt;/div&gt;";
    }
    
    return buf;
}
</pre>

            <p>

                The function uses the properties in the news item object that the FeedUpdateBroker
                created for us. There's a date property that has the publish date of the news item.
                There's a description that contains the actual summary, and there's a URL that points
                to the website where the full article is. Note that we're using the openURL() wrapper
                function that we just wrote for the link to the full article.
            </p>

            <p>

                Our HTML is very simple: three div-tags that have the date, description and a link as
                their content. And ech of them has a CSS class so that we can match them with some
                style rules. Since we have three different pieces of data we need three CSS rules:
                FeedItemDate for the date, FeedItemDescription for the news item summary and finally
                FeedItemLink for the link to the website. Let's create these in the RSSReader.css
                stylesheet file:
            </p>

<pre>


/* Feed item date */
.FeedItemDate {
    font-style: italic;
}

/* Feed item text */
.FeedItemDescription {
    padding: 4px 0px;
}

/* Feed item links */
.FeedItemLink {
    
}

/* Anchor tags in the context of a feed item link */
.FeedItemLink a {
    text-decoration: underline;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: rgb(0,0,255);
}

/* Focused anchor tags */
.FeedItemLink a:focus {
    background: rgb(0,0,255);
    color: rgb(255,255,255);
}
</pre>

            <p>

                The rule for links can be left empty because we will just use default ContentPanel
                content styling. However we'll change the way the link looks in the context of that
                FeedItemLink div. We'll make links blue, bold and underlined in their normal state
                and inverse with a blue background and white text color when focused.
            </p>

            <p>

                Now that we have a function that generates HTML for the ContentPanel we can remove
                the placeholder content replace it with a call to our function:
            </p>

<pre>

feedItemControl.setContent(getContentHTMLForFeedItem(item));
</pre>

            <p>

                We're done! Now you can try the widget in a PC browser and then on the handset
                or emulator.

What we have learned</h2>

            
            <p>

                The RSS Reader tutorial has taught us several things. We have learned to create a widget
                that has more than just one view. We have learned how to use several new WRTKit controls.
                We used the SelectionList, SelectionMenu and FormButton controls in our settings view, 
                and in the main view we used the ContentPanel control that allowed us to add our own
                content as a seamless part of the rest of the user interface using HTML fragments that
                we styled with CSS rules. We have learned to modify a view while the widget runs by adding
                and removing controls. And we have learned how to separate our widget code so that the
                user interface code doesn't contain any logic code and so that the logic code doesn't
                contain any user interface code.
