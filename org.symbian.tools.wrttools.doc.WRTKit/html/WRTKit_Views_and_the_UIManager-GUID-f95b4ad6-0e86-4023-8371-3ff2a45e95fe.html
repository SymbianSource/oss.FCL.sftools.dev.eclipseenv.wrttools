Views and the UIManager</h1>

    <div>

        <p>

            All WRTKit user interfaces are divided into "views". The concept of 
            a view is simply a set of user interface elements, such as buttons, 
            textfields, etc., that are hosted in a container. The WRTKit 
            architecture defines a contract for views through a base class 
            called View and implements a concrete view class called ListView 
            that lays out controls vertically. This layout is similar to what is 
            commonly used in mobile device user interfaces and is thus 
            sufficient for the vast majority of widget user interfaces. However 
            the WRTKit allows developers to create their own custom views if 
            some other kind of layout is preferred instead. Creating a custom 
            view is an advanced topic that isn't covered here, but roughly 
            speaking it is a simple matter of creating a subclass of the View 
            class (just like ListView) and implementing all the functions that 
            the View class defines, plus whatever custom layout the developer 
            wants.
        </p>

        <p>

            Because the ListView uses a vertical list layout for controls, 
            adding controls can be done either to the end of the list or by 
            inserting before a specified control in the list. There is no need 
            to worry about actual control locations, coordinates or anything of 
            that sort. The ListViews handles all of this automatically.
        </p>

        <p>

            In addition to controls, the ListView has a view caption that is 
            displayed at the very top of the view. The caption is optional but 
            is good to include in order to show what a particular view is about. 
            E.g. a view for settings could have a caption "Settings".

            Only one view can be visible at any given time, as is common in 
            mobile device applications. Views are commanded to be shown using a 
            class called UIManager, which attaches the view to the "view root". 
            The view root is an HTML element that can be specified to the 
            UIManager when it is created, but typically this argument is 
            omitted, resulting in the UIManager creating a view root element 
            that makes views take up the entire screen.
