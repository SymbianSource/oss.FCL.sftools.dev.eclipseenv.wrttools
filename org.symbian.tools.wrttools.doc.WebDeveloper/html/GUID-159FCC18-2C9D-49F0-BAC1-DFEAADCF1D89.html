<p>The amount of power an application consumes is affected by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Timers.</p></li>
<li><p>Backlight.</p></li>
<li><p>Network connections.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="GUID-B77C2006-879F-4AC6-B7BF-04B25B563A29.html#GUID-B77C2006-879F-4AC6-B7BF-04B25B563A29">Sensors</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For more tips on how to manage the power consumption of an application, see <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/resources/development_process/power_management/" target="_blank">Power Management</a> on Forum Nokia.</p>
<p>You can use the power information services to determine what the battery level is on a device and whether the charger is connected to the device. For more information, see <a href="GUID-6521F749-FA06-493B-A11D-B47F4DC0E6D6.html#GUID-6521F749-FA06-493B-A11D-B47F4DC0E6D6">Power information services</a>.</p>
<div><h3>Using timers</h3><p>You can use timers to update content that you fetch from the device. Observe the following guidelines:</p><ul>
<li><p>Turn off timers when they are no longer needed or when the application is moved to the background.</p></li>
<li><p> Do not fire timers at minimum intervals (for example, 10 ms) for long periods of time. Firing timers at longer intervals (for example, every 1 to 2 seconds) does not necessarily have a significant effect.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<div><h3>Using device backlight</h3><p>The backlight of the mobile device screen consumes energy. Do not override the default backlight settings unless it is absolutely necessary.</p></div>
<div><h3>Creating network connections</h3><p>Implement a reasonable schedule for retrieving data via network connections. For example, retrieve news data once in an hour. Optimize the amount of data that is transferred.
