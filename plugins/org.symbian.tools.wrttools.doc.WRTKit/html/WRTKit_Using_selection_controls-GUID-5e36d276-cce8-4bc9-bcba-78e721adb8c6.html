Using selection controls</h1>

    <div>

        <p>

            Selection controls are used to let users make selections among a set 
            of options. The WRTKit has two controls: SelectionList and 
            SelectionMenu that have an identical API but differ in look and 
            feel. The SelectionList shows all the options and selections 
            directly in the view while the SelectionMenu only shows the selected 
            options and opens up a menu with the options when the user activates 
            the control. Selection controls can either be in single or multiple
            selection mode. In single selection mode only one of the options can
            be selected at a time while in multiple selection mode any number
            (including zero) can be selected.
        </p>

        <div class="fignone" id="GUID-5E36D276-CCE8-4BC9-BCBA-78E721ADB8C6__GUID-9F9B7E8B-2E27-4D95-AFBD-246DD16580B2"><a name="GUID-5E36D276-CCE8-4BC9-BCBA-78E721ADB8C6__GUID-9F9B7E8B-2E27-4D95-AFBD-246DD16580B2"><!-- --></a><span class="figcap">Figure 1.

        <p>

            The SelectionList control is recommended to be used with the pointer 
            navigation mode or if there are few options to choose from. The 
            SelectionMenu control is recommended for large numbers of options or in 
            the tab navigation mode.
        </p>

        <div class="fignone" id="GUID-5E36D276-CCE8-4BC9-BCBA-78E721ADB8C6__GUID-B3A04D05-2DA2-48B1-B37F-F0803B499DCC"><a name="GUID-5E36D276-CCE8-4BC9-BCBA-78E721ADB8C6__GUID-B3A04D05-2DA2-48B1-B37F-F0803B499DCC"><!-- --></a><span class="figcap">Figure 2.

        </div>

        <p>

            The options of a selection control are defined as an array of option 
            objects, each with two properties: value and text. The value 
            property can be any JavaScript value and represent the concrete 
            value of the option, while the text property is a string that is 
            shown in the user interface for the option.
        </p>

        <p>

            Option arrays can conveniently be created using JavaScript object
            notation (JSON) for example as follows:
        </p>

<pre>

// create an array with three options
var options = [
        { value: 1, text: "Coffee" },
        { value: 2, text: "Tea" },
        { value: 3, text: "Water" }
    ];
</pre>

        <p>

            The selected options are defined differently depending on whether 
            the selection control is in single or multiple selection mode. In 
            single selection mode the selected option is defined as a reference 
            to the option in the control that should be selected. In multiple 
            selection mode the selected options set is defined as an array of 
            references to options in the control. Note that the references must 
            be to one of the options objects defined for the control. It is not 
            sufficient to define new option objects that happen to be identical 
            to the ones in the control.
        </p>

<pre>

// create a set of two selected options for multiple selection control
var selectedOptions = [ options[1], options[2] ];
</pre>

        <p>

            Note that the selectedOptions array is constructed so that the two 
            elements in the array refer to the "Tea" and "Water" options in the 
            options array.
        </p>

        <p>

            The code below creates a SelectionList control in multiple selection
            mode and initializes it with the options and selectedOptions arrays
            created above. The code assumes that a view has already been created
            and that a variable called exampleView refers to it.
        </p>

<pre>

// create selection list control
var drinkList = new SelectionList("selection1", "Favorite drinks",
                                  options, true, selectedOptions);
exampleView.addControl(drinkList);
</pre>

        <p>

            "selection1" is a unique identifier for the control, "Favorite 
            drinks" is the control caption, the option argument refers to the 
            options array that we previously created, the following argument 
            determines whether the control is in multiple selection mode, and 
            finally the selectedOptions argument refers to the array with 
            selected options and defines which of the options in the control
            should be selected by default.
        </p>

        <p>

            All of the arguments are optional and can be specified later as
            needed. For example if the options are not known when the control
            is created, or if the options change, they can be set using the
            setOptions() method. In the same way the selected options can be
            set using the setSelected() method.
        </p>

<pre>

// set options
drinkList.setOptions(options);

// set selected options
drinkList.setSelected(selectedOptions);
</pre>

        <p>

            The currently selected options can be retrieved using the 
            getSelected() method. As mentioned earlier, in single selection mode 
            the selected is just a single reference to an option (or null if no 
            option is selected), while in multiple selection mode it's an array 
            with references to the selected options. If no options are selected 
            in multiple selection mode then the array is empty.
        </p>

<pre>

// find out which options are currently selected
var selected = drinkList.getSelected();
</pre>

        <p>

            Selection controls fire "SelectionChanged" events when a user changes
            the selection of options in a control. These events can be handled
            using by registering an event listener to the control. The code below
            shows what a typical callback function would look like:
        </p>

<pre>

// Callback function for selection change events.
function favoriteDrinkChanged(event) {
    // implement what happens when the selection changed here
}
</pre>

        <p>

            Registering the event listener function is done as follows, for
            example right after the control was created:
        </p>

<pre>

// register event listener
drinkList.addEventListener("SelectionChanged", favoriteDrinkChanged);
</pre>
